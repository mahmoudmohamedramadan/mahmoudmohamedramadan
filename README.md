# Howdy there, I'm Mahmoud 🙌

## 🤵 About me

I am a software engineer, the creator of [Digging Code](https://blog.mmramadan.com), and an active contributor to open-source projects. With years of experience, I'm a specialist in solving complex software challenges and have received positive feedback from **developers worldwide** and **clients on freelancing platforms**.

I am passionate about open-source development and have contributed to many well-known projects, including the **Laravel Framework**, **Orchid Platform**, and **Select2 Package**.

In addition to contributing to existing projects, I also create open-source tools designed to make developers' lives easier. Some of my projects include the [Easy Model](https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/easy-model) for **Laravel developers**, the [Midnight Echo](https://github.com/mahmoudmohamedramadan/midnight-echo) for **VS Code users**, and several full Laravel applications. I’m always seeking new opportunities to release tools that streamline development and improve efficiency.

As a problem solver, I also actively contribute to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11019205), where I’ve answered numerous questions on various topics, including **SQL**, **PHP**, and the **Laravel Framework**.
